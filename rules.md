# **Fundamentals**

**Designing content for experiences**

These fundamentals apply to every piece of content you create. For specific questions, dig into our detailed content guidelines for everything from [grammar](https://polaris-react.shopify.com/content/grammar-and-mechanics) to [components](https://polaris-react.shopify.com/components).

Think of tools you use every day, such as your phone, car, or blender. They all have a learning curve, but the very best of them feel easy from the very first use. Buttons are where you expect them. Labeling is intuitive. Everything unnecessary has been removed, and what’s left is the perfect balance of words and visuals. That’s what we’re building here at Shopify.

## **Content 🤝 design**

Words are an essential part of the design. Very few interfaces make sense without content. But each word and every period adds noise to the experience. So weigh every word.

- Only add content that’s necessary for clarity
- Let visuals and icons do the talking wherever you can (“+” not “+ Add”)
- Remember design doesn’t always dictate content (not every situation calls for subcopy, even if the component has been designed to include it)

**Tip:** Ask yourself, could this word be an icon? Could this header, subcopy, and button just be a button?

## **Keep it lean**

Too much content makes a tool feel cheap and that it’s hard to use. Not enough leads to confusion and frustration. Great design means finding that sweet spot.

- Find the shortest, clearest way to give merchants only the info they need to take action
- Skip the punctuation (exceptions: questions or text with 2+ sentences)
- Get rid of any repetition

**Tip:** Approach content like Jenga. What’s the most you can take away before things fall apart?

## **Write like merchants talk**

Don’t worry too much about voice and tone, just focus on sounding human

- Use plain language
- Use contractions (“don’t” not “do not”)
- Some jargon is okay, as long as it’s what actual merchants say
- Aim for a 7th grade reading level—it’s easiest for merchants to digest

**Tip:** Read it out loud. Does it sound like something a human would say? Ship it.

## **Inspire action**

Don’t overwhelm people with too many choices or too much info upfront

- Focus on the one thing merchants need to know or do next
- Start sentences with verbs so they feel like actionable instructions
- Be direct (“add apps” not “you can add apps”)
- Use design (font size, location on the screen) to communicate importance
- Break multi-part tasks down into digestible steps (aka “progressive disclosure”)

**Tip:** What’s the most important thing for merchants to do here? If it’s not clear, start over.

# **Grammar**

**For anyone who writes for the admin**

## **Addresses**

### **Address**

Lay out address forms in the following format:

Example

```
First name             Last name
Address
Apartment, suite, etc. (optional)
City
Country            Province           Postal code
```

Please note, “optional” in **Apartment, suite, etc. (optional)** means that the field is optional for customers to complete, but we should always include it in the form.

**Do**

- Use locale-specific alternatives for province and postal code, for example, the US uses State and ZIP code

**Don't**

- Add extra fields
- Change the placeholder text

### **Country, province, and state names**

Use a nation’s proper name when referring to it as a noun.

**Do**

- Your store must be located in the United States.

**Don't**

- Your store must be located in the US.

When using a country as an adjective (such as when referring to currency), use the abbreviated form without punctuation.

**Do**

- Pinterest requires your store to use US currency.

**Don't**

- U.S. currency

Things to watch for:

- Don’t use colloquial forms of a nation or state name, for example, America instead of the United States
- Search online to see whether nations commonly use “the” before their name, for example, the Philippines or the Falkland Islands

## **Capitalization**

**Use sentence case (capitalize the first word only) for:**

- Headings
- Subheadings
- Buttons
- Card titles
- Email subject lines

**Do**

- Create purchase order

**Don't**

- Create Purchase Order

**Capitalize:**

- Proper or trademarked nouns (names of products/brands, countries, people)
- Product names unique to Shopify
- Job titles when they come before or after a person’s name

**Do**

- Shopify Payments
- Jane Smith, Content Strategist

**Don't**

- shopify balance
- Jane Smith, content strategist

**Use lowercase for:**

- Features or product terms not unique to Shopify
- Job titles without a name associated with them
- First letter following a /

**Do**

- blogs, navigation, admin, page
- The content strategist designed this
- ZIP/postal code

**Don't**

- Blogs, Navigation, Admin, Page
- The Content Strategist designed this
- ZIP/Postal code

## **Contractions**

Use contractions—they’re short and conversational

**Do**

- Can't, it’s, you’re, doesn’t

**Don't**

- Can not, it is, you are, does not

## **Formatting**

### **Bold**

When in doubt, don’t bold.

Use bold sparingly and only where strong emphasis is required. Don’t use bold to create a heading or emphasize:

- Proper nouns
- Merchant input
- Checkbox titles

**Do**

- After your first sale, PayPal will email you at [**merchant@email.com**](mailto:merchant@email.com) with instructions.

**Don't**

- Are you sure you want to delete **Sunset T-shirt**?

## **Headings**

Headings and subheadings are titles and subtitles that refer to sections of the interface.

### **Basic structure**

Headings and subheadings should be:

**Informative and descriptive:**

- Highlight the most important concept or piece of information for merchants
- Help merchants understand what they’ll find in the section below

**Concise and scannable:**

- Use simple, clear language
- Keep headings to a single sentence
- Avoid using punctuation such as periods, commas, or semicolons
- Write in sentence case (capitalize the first word and proper nouns only)
- Whether or not to use articles (“the,” “a,” “an”) in headings and subheadings depends on the type of message.

**Do**

- Online store dashboard
- Custom reports
- Sell your products in person

**Don't**

- This is your online store dashboard
- Custom Reports
- Sell your products in person!

### **Conversational headings**

For more conversational areas of the product, like Home cards, sell pages, and empty states, use articles. It makes the language more approachable and helps people to understand new, complex concepts.

**Do**

- Secure your account with two-step authentication

**Don't**

- Two-step authentication

## **Links**

Avoid links if possible:

- Links add clutter and make things feel less like software, more like an old-fashioned webpage
- Merchants are already in the habit of visiting the help center or using sidekick if they have Qs, so building links into the interface is rarely necessary

If you have to point merchants to added info:

- Never use “click here” or “here” for link text
- For added info that it’s essential for most merchants to know, use the info icon (for short, stand-alone info), an embedded link (within the flow of an existing sentence), or a “learn more” link (for longer, multi-faceted info)
- If you have to include “learn more” links, avoid having more than one per screen
- Keep punctuation outside the link unless the link is a stand-alone sentence (exception: question marks)

**Do**

- Set up your store with a [step-by-step guide](https://polaris-react.shopify.com/content/grammar-and-mechanics#links)
- Show up where shoppers scroll, search, and shop with [multichannel integration](https://polaris-react.shopify.com/content/grammar-and-mechanics#links).

## **Lists**

### **Bulleted**

Use a bulleted list when items are related but sequence or priority doesn’t matter. Introduce the list with a full sentence and a colon.

Capitalize the first word of the bullet.

**Do**

Using Shopify Payments in your store provides the following benefits:

### **Numbered**

Use a numbered list when item sequence or priority does matter. Introduce the list with a full sentence and a colon.

If at least one of the numbered bullet points requires a period due to having two sentences, then include punctuation on all the bullets. Avoid lists that have both single words and sentences as bullet points.

Capitalize the first word of the bullet.

**Do**

When checking out from your online store, the customer goes through the following steps:

1. Adds the products that they want to purchase to their cart
2. Goes to the cart page and proceeds to the checkout
3. Enters their shipping details
4. Enters their payment details
5. Confirms and places the order

**Don't**

2. goes to the cart page and proceeds to the checkout
3. enters their shipping details
4. enters their payment details
5. confirms and places the order

### **Actions in a menu**

Menu lists give users a horizontal set of actions when space is limited. The order of actions is often based on logic, such as most popular actions.

Actions in a menu follow a {verb}+{noun} pattern. If there’s enough context, only a verb might be required.

**Do**

- Rename
- Edit
- HTML
- Duplicate

**Don't**

- HTML
- editing options
- File name changes

### **Nouns in a menu**

Menu lists give users a horizontal set of nouns when space is limited. The order of nouns is often based on logic, such as most recent orders.

Nouns in a menu should be concise, but still give the user enough information so that they can easily find and accurately select the item that they want.

**Do**

Select filter

- Today
- Yesterday
- This week
- This month

**Don't**

- Filter visibility
- Filter product type

Company name

- hidden
- optional
- required

### **Punctuation in lists**

- Introduce bulleted lists with a colon or a heading.
- Don’t use commas at the end of list items (for bulleted or numbered lists).
- If any list item contains two or more sentences, punctuate all list items.
- If all list items are one sentence or fragments, don’t punctuate. This doesn't apply to procedural steps, which should end with punctuation.
- Never put a comma or semicolon at the end of a bulleted or numbered list item.
- Treat each list item as a self-contained piece of information.

## **Numbers, dates, and currency**

### **Numbers**

Use numerals

**Do**

- 9
- 100
- You have 5 orders to fulfill.

**Don't**

- one hundred
- You have five orders to fulfill.

Use commas for numbers with four or more digits. Avoid shortening numbers.

**Do**

Use hyphens when writing phone numbers. Don’t use brackets, spaces, periods, or plus signs:

**Do**

- 1-514-555-1234

**Don't**

- 613.555.1234
- 1-(514)-555-1234

For number ranges, use an en dash without a space on either side

**Do**

- 5–10 products
- October 15–31

**Don't**

- 5 – 10 products
- October 15 – 31

For undefined upward ranges, use “and up” or “or more”

**Do**

- $50.00 and up
- 100 or more

**Don't**

- $50.00+
- > 100

For downward ranges, be specific.

**Do**

$0.00–$49.99

**Don't**

$50.00 or less

### **Date**

Use the month’s full name. If there isn’t enough space, use 3-letter abbreviations. Don’t write dates with numerals only.

**Do**

- December 11, 2024
- Dec 11, 2024
- Oct 15, 2015

**Don't**

- December 11, ’24
- 12/11/24

Don’t use ordinal indicators, which are words representing position or rank in a sequential order (1st, 2nd, 3rd, and so on).

**Do**

January 23–April 1

**Don't**

January 23rd–April 1st

**Note**: Dates, numbers, and measurements are often formatted automatically according to users’ local preferences, and they may be formatted differently in other languages. These guidelines are for manually formatting in American English, which we use as a base before translating to other languages.

### **Time**

For all translations, the time format is automatically localized by the **Intl.DateTimeFormat** JavaScript object. When time must be formatted manually, follow these guidelines:

- Use the 12-hour clock, followed by am or pm
- Include a space after the last number. For example, “Your package will arrive at 12:35 pm.”
- Use the browser time of the logged in user
- To show a time range, use an en dash and include the am/pm after both times, for example, 3:00 pm–4:00 pm
- If indicating both the date and time, separate them with the word “at” instead of a comma

### **Time zones**

- Include a time zone only if it’s necessary, such as for an event listing.
- Use the time zone’s abbreviation following the am or pm, for example, 4:00 pm NZT.
- If your audience is in a single time zone, then don’t include an S (for Standard) or D (for Daylight). For example, 3:00 pm PT.
- If your audience is in a combination of time zones, then include the S (for Standard) or D (for Daylight) to avoid confusion. For example, 3:00 pm PDT.

- Yesterday: **Yesterday at 10:30 am**
- In the last 7 days: **Friday at 10:30 am**
- 7 days to 1 year: **Aug 14 at 10:30 am**

The ellipses (…) can be used in place of a missing piece of text (most commonly to show the deletion of words from a direct quotation). Avoid using ellipses in text.

Use ellipses for:

- Truncation in the center of a title bar

Don’t use ellipses for:

- Placeholder copy
- Trailing off a sentence

**Do**

Search files

**Don't**

### **Truncation**

Consider constraints of the space in the interface when deciding to use truncation. Think about what part of the string merchants needs most. It’s usually the beginning or end, which means you might have to truncate the middle of the string.

### **Ellipses button component**

A button with an ellipsis icon (not the same as text) is used to expand more actions. It’s typically used in cards, or for horizontal sets of actions when space is limited.

### **En-dashes and em-dashes**

Use an en dash with no spaces in between (–) for a fixed range of numbers

**Do**

Tip: On Mac the keyboard shortcuts are option - for en dash and shift option - for em dash.

### **Exclamation marks**

Avoid exclamation marks—only use them for really really exciting things. If you absolutely have to, limit yourself to one exclamation mark per page.

**Do**

You’ve launched your first online store!

**Don't**

You’ve updated your product title!

### **Hyphens**

Use hyphens to:

- Form compound modifiers: two words that combine to modify or describe the noun that follows

**Do**

- Start your free, no-risk, 14-day trial.
- This is a high-risk order.
- This order is high risk.
- Add weight-based shipping rates.
- Add rates based on the weight of an order.

**Don't**

- Start your free, no risk, 14 day trial.
- This is a high risk order.
- This order is high-risk.
- Add weight based shipping rates.
- Join prefixes and suffixes only if there are two vowels beside each other. Never use hyphens in the words ecommerce and email.

**Do**

- Re-order
- Resend

**Don't**

- Reorder
- Reenable
- Re-send

### **Periods**

- Don't use periods in interface copy
- If text includes 2 or more sentences, it's okay to use periods

**Do**

Add products to collections so they're easy to find

**Don't**

Add products to collections so they're easy to find.

### **Periods for bulleted, numbered, and lists of links**

**Do**

- Use when a list item has two or more full sentences, then also add periods to the whole list
- Use for the description or helper text below a bulleted or numbered list item

**Don't**

- Don’t use periods when a list has only single sentences or fragments
- Don’t use periods for lists of links

### **Question marks**

Avoid question marks wherever possible. Reword into affirmative statements wherever you can, but there are exceptions:

It’s okay to use question marks if you don’t know the result of the question:

- “Did you forget your password?”
- “Do you need to add a shipping rate?”

Don’t use question marks if:

- It’s the only option available: “Reset password”
- It’s an on/off option: “Show quantity box”

**Do**

- Forgot?

**Don't**

- Reset password?

### **Quotation marks**

Use quotation marks to:

- Define words (“growth-hacking”)
- Quote text

When it’s helpful to the merchant, use quotation marks to indicate input that the merchant has provided, such as a product title or file name. Use this indication only when the input appears in running text.

**Do**

- Are you sure you want to delete “cat shirt”?
- “Nike Air Max 90.png” failed to upload

**Don't**

- Are you sure you want to delete **cat shirt**?
- Nike Air Max 90.png failed to upload

In general, place commas and periods inside quotation marks. When working with literal strings like typed commands or merchant inputs, place punctuation outside the quotation marks.

**Do**

- “I see this all the time,” said Mary.
- Avoid general words like “all,” “every,” or “most.”
- To remove this item, type “DELETE”.

**Don't**

- “I don’t understand why”, said Mitch.
- We call it a “store”, not a “shop”.
- There was an error with the file “cat_shirt.png.”

Always use smart (curly) quotes, not vertical (straight) quotes.

**Do**

- ‘  +
  option
  ]
- ’  +  +
  option
  shift
  ]
- “  +
  option
  [
- ”  +  +
  option
  shift
  [

**Don't**

- " or '

### **Semicolons**

Avoid semicolons if possible. If you really need them, use semicolons to:

- Connect two closely related ideas, as long as they are both independent clauses (full sentences that could stand on their own).
- Replace a comma or the word “and” between two closely related ideas.

**Do**

My friends made me banana pancakes on my birthday; I’ve never been happier.

**Don't**

The unicorn was hungry; the grass was brown.

## **Spelling**

### **American spelling**

Use American spelling for all external-facing Shopify content. When in doubt, check the [Merriam-Webster dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/) for the preferred spelling of specific terms.

**Do**

- Color
- Center
- Canceled

**Don't**

- Colour
- Centre
- Cancelled

Tip: it’s easy to miss Canadian spelling. Switch your laptop language settings to American English and turn spell check on. It will highlight any Canadianisms you might have missed.

# **Error messages**

**Make it clear what went wrong and how to fix it**

Error messages should:

- Explain what’s wrong and what the merchant needs to do
- Be specific (exact numbers and dates, or even the merchant’s own data)
- Don’t overapologize or bring “us”/”we” into the conversation unless Shopify caused the problem
- Avoid error jargon like “invalid”
- Use detailed instructions for the next step
- Help merchants avoid mistakes in the first place, using clear content to manage expectations and highlight potential risks
- Only explain what happened behind the scenes when it’s helpful to merchants or you can’t offer a solution

As always, follow our content [fundamentals](https://polaris-react.shopify.com/content/fundamentals) of keeping it short, using plain language, and getting rid of repetition.

## **Design for clarity**

- Use iconography and color to communicate the severity of the problem and draw the merchant’s attention to what’s wrong
- Place the error close to what needs fixed
- Use red for critical messages that merchants need to deal with immediately to avoid harm to their business form validation errors
- Use yellow for errors that are part of a daily workflow or warnings that could lead to critical errors if not addressed

## **Anatomy of an error message**

### **Heading (optional)**

- Clearly state the effect of the error on the merchant
- Command immediate attention

### **Body**

- If you don’t have a header, clearly state the effect of the error on the merchant
- Explain how to fix it
- Link to help documentation

### **CTA (optional)**

- Provide a one-step solution
- Take merchants to another location expressly for fixing the issue

## **Examples**

### **Multiple errors**

**Do**

To save this product, make 2 changes:

- Enter title
- Add weight

**Don't**

There are 2 errors on this page.

- Invalid title
- Weight must be a number value greater than 0.1 lb

### **Settings warning**

# **Naming**

**What to consider as you name products or features**

## **Thoughtful naming**

Names influence how merchants and other audiences perceive and understand Shopify. A well-chosen name will:

- Put clarity above creativity
- Help establish a mental model for our audiences
- Enhance people’s perception of our brand
- Increase adoption of the product or feature
- Differentiate Shopify from other products
- Clarify where a product or feature fits into our brand system

The naming process involves collaboration. Include different disciplines and people with different subject matter expertise in the creation of a name.

## **Does it need a branded name?**

Most features don’t need an official, branded name. For example, order entry is a feature that’s referred to descriptively and so doesn’t need to be capitalized. When choosing what to call a feature, pick words that describe what the feature does or represents. If there’s room, add extra context for merchants by describing the feature instead of using only the feature name.

Avoid capitalizing descriptive feature names.

**Do**

- Order entry

**Don't**

- Order Entry

If there‘s room, describe the feature instead of defaulting to only using the name.

**Do**

- Display carrier calculated shipping rates to your customers at checkout.

**Don't**

- Display carrier calculated shipping rates.

### **Using “Shopify”**

Only Shopify can use the word “Shopify” in a name. The word “Shopify” can’t be used to name third-party products.

It’s important we use the word “Shopify” consistently, and sparingly. Don’t use “Shopify” in a name unless there’s a lack of surrounding context and we want its target audience to know it’s associated with Shopify.

Adding “Shopify” doesn’t add clarity in the context of other Shopify products and features. For example, merchants often confuse Shopify Shipping with the other shipping features, like shipping settings, carrier calculated shipping rates, shipping labels, and shipping zones. Our support staff have to refer to the Shopify Plan by its cost because the general name doesn’t distinguish it from the other plans.

Use “Shopify” in front of a name when a product:

- Is or will become a separate product or platform and we need to associate it with Shopify
- Should be differentiated from other, similar products in the industry
- Doesn’t justify an [evocative name](https://polaris-react.shopify.com/content/naming#descriptive-vs-evocative-names), but still needs to associated with Shopify

Don’t use “Shopify” in a name for built in functionality features, like fraud analysis or importing products.

**Do**

- Shopify Payments
- Shopify App Store
- Shopify Theme Store

**Don't**

- Shopify Analytics
- Shopify Discounts
- Shopify Account

Shopify makes apps that merchants can add to their Shopify admin. It’s okay to say “Built by Shopify” or “Made by Shopify” after the app name. Once you’ve picked the format that works for the design, use it consistently.

**Do**

- *Shopify* Product Reviews
- *Shopify* Order Printer
- *Shopify* Shopcodes

**Don't**

- Product Reviews
- Order Printer
- Shopcodes

Apps that aren’t built by Shopify should not use the word “Shopify” in their name or say “for Shopify” after the name.

**Do**

- AdSpace
- Email Marketing

**Don't**

- AdSpace for Shopify
- Email Marketing for Shopify

## **Descriptive vs evocative names**

There are two types of approaches to naming, the descriptive approach, or the evocative approach. Descriptive names are concrete, while evocative can be more abstract. Descriptive names are merchant friendly, and the most common. Features should always have descriptive names. Standalone products that require independent branding can use evocative names. Third-party apps and channels should have their own branded names and should never use the word “Shopify” in the name.

If you’re a Shopify employee and are looking to trademark an evocative name, ask the legal department for help.

### **Descriptive names**

Features and products connected to Shopify’s main product offering should have names that reveal something about their purpose. Avoid jargon and make sure the name you pick won’t get confused with similar names or terms.

Reserve evocative naming conventions for standalone products like Kit, and Frenzy.

Descriptive names should:

- Describe the experiences they represent
- Fit into the information architecture of the product
- Use merchant-friendly terms, not industry standard terms
- Make sense in marketing materials
- Align with brand

If it’s a default feature (merchants don’t have to sign up or opt in to use it), don’t [capitalize](https://polaris-react.shopify.com/content/naming#general-guidelines) it.

**Do**

- Shopify Capital
- fraud analysis
- Use analytics to review your store’s transactions

**Don't**

- Shopify capital
- Fraud Analysis
- Use Analytics to review your store’s transactions

Avoid jargon and give merchants a hint about the actions they’ll be able to take when they interact with the product or feature.

**Do**

- Shopify Help Center
- Shopify Theme Store
- discounts
- Logo maker

**Don't**

- Shopify Help Documentation
- Configuration app
- Shipity-do-dah

### **Evocative names**

Standalone products use evocative names to position us in the industry. These unique and bold naming conventions can help with branding or recall, but don’t always help people understand the experience. They’re better for standalone products, and not for experiences that are part of Shopify’s main product offering.

Sometimes Shopify acquires a product or service that already has a unique, branded name. Even though it may become more tied to Shopify, it can keep its name to maintain its brand identity. This also helps maintain the context audiences already have about the product, like in the case of Kit.

Certain standalone names use the word “Shopify” because it differentiates the product from similar ones in the industry, like Shopify Pay in comparison to Apple Pay, or Android Pay. For more details, see the [guidelines for using “Shopify” in a name](https://polaris-react.shopify.com/content/naming#does-it-need-a-branded-name-).

Evocative names should:

- Have a strong, independent brand identity
- Help with branding or recall
- Reflect the concept it represents
- Make sense when used in marketing materials

If you work at Shopify and want to trademark a name, talk to the legal department. It’s easier to trademark unique or made-up name. These names have stronger identities, but it’s not always clear what they do.

**Do**

- Frenzy
- Kit
- Oberlo

**Don't**

- Flash sales app
- The Marketing Bot
- Drop Shipping app

Some evocative names can be more descriptive, although they’re harder to trademark if they use common terminology. Not all evocative names need to be trademarked.

**Do**

- Burst
- Shop Class

**Don't**

- Free Stock Photography
- Learn about Shopify event

If you’re creating a website or product for an existing brand, maintain its brand identity and keep “Shopify” out of the name.

**Do**

- Kylie Jenner Pop-up Shop
- Kylie *Powered by Shopify*

**Don't**

- Shopify Pop-up, featuring Kylie Jenner

## **Shopify products and features**

An off-brand and unclear name can confuse your audience. It can also feel disconnected from the rest of Shopify.

A good product or feature name should:

- Help merchants understand what the experience represents
- Fit into the information architecture of the product or website in which it belongs
- Make sense when compared to other products, features, websites, or events in the same market
- Avoid any negative or weird connotations

There are two types of approaches to naming, the [descriptive approach, or the evocative approach](https://polaris-react.shopify.com/content/naming#descriptive-vs-evocative-names).

### **Referring to Shopify and areas in the admin**

Use consistent and easy to understand descriptions when referring to locations in product, especially in [help documentation](https://polaris-react.shopify.com/content/help-documentation#navigation). Descriptive feature names aren’t [capitalized](https://polaris-react.shopify.com/content/naming#general-guidelines), but when providing steps in a workflow, it’s okay to capitalize the page name, for example, “Go to the Products page”. Note that the page name is capitalized, but “page” isn’t.

When referring to Shopify’s main product offering, use “Shopify”. The only exception is when you need to differentiate it from another product, like the mobile app, or explain a task specific to the admin. In these cases, you can use “Shopify admin”.

A good description can:

- Help establish a mental model for merchants
- Clarify where the area fits into the product system
- Help support staff and merchants understand each other when communicating

A good description should:

- Avoid jargon
- Be used consistently
- Describe the area it represents
- Prioritize terminology used by merchants over industry standards

Use consistent descriptions when referring to areas in the Shopify admin.

**Do**

- The customer list is found on the Customers page.
- When a new customer places an order with your store, their name and information are automatically added to your customer list.

**Don't**

- Manage customers in Customers.
- Customer information is automatically added to Customers in the Shopify admin.

Merchants call our main product offering “Shopify”, so we use that same terminology. terminology

**Do**

- Use “Shopify” when talking about our main product offering
- Use “Shopify admin” if you need to differentiate it from the mobile app

**Don't**

- Don’t use “admin” or “Shopify admin” if “Shopify” will do

Top-level marketing content is created for audiences who have little context about Shopify. Since they may not know about specific Shopify products, we use “Shopify” here too.

**Do**

- Run your business using Shopify
- Print shipping labels directly through Shopify

**Don't**

- Use our ecommerce platform
- Print shipping labels directly through Shopify’s admin

### **Using “app” and “channel”**

For app names in areas with surrounding context, like in the app store or on the Apps page in the Shopify admin, don’t add the word “app” to the end of the name.

**Do**

- Oberlo
- Script Editor

**Don't**

- Oberlo app
- Script Editor app

For app names without surrounding context, like in search in the Shopify admin, or on a home card, add “app” so merchants know what it is.

**Do**

- Bulk Account Order app

**Don't**

- Bulk Account Order

When writing about channels, make it clear to merchants that they are interacting with a channel through Shopify, and not through the other company.

**Do**

- The Amazon channel now supports electronics listings

**Don't**

- Amazon now supports electronics listings

If “channel” is used somewhere in surrounding content, it’s okay to drop it for titles and button copy. titles

**Do**

- Add Amazon

**Don't**

- Add Amazon channel

Not every channel is a sales channel. For example, BuzzFeed is a marketing outreach channel and Facebook is a sales and marketing channel. Clarify channel types when you have room, otherwise default to channel. If there’s surrounding context, you can drop channel altogether.

If there’s surrounding context, drop the word channel from the name.

**Do**

- Google Shopping

**Don't**

- Google Shopping channel

If there’s room for a description, explain the channel type.

**Do**

- Use BuzzFeed’s marketing outreach channel to get more customers.

**Don't**

- Use the BuzzFeed channel to get more customers.

## **General guidelines**

In general, capitalize evocative names and don’t capitalize feature names. Avoid acronyms, and think about how your audience will interpret a name.

### **Capitalization**

Don’t capitalize default features. Default features are built into Shopify and merchants don’t have to sign up, add, or opt in to use them. Analytics and discounts are examples of default features.

Capitalizing names should only happen:

- For independently branded, [evocative names](https://polaris-react.shopify.com/content/naming#descriptive-vs-evocative-names)
- When we want to try and claim specific words (think Tweet or Pin)
- For names listed in top level navigation, like Products

**Do**

- Shopify Hardware Store
- Shopify Theme Store
- Black Friday Cyber Monday (BFCM)
- Retail Package
- Buy Button

**Don't**

- Shopify hardware store
- Shopify theme store
- Black friday cyber monday (bfcm)
- Retail package
- Buy button

Names shouldn’t be capitalized if they:

- Are [descriptive](https://polaris-react.shopify.com/content/naming#descriptive-vs-evocative-names)
- Include common, familiar words
- Are default features

**Do**

- analytics
- fraud analysis
- online store
- themes

**Don't**

- Shopify Analytics
- Fraud Analysis
- Online Store
- Themes

### **Acronyms and abbreviations**

An acronym is a word formed from parts of an existing compound term. For example, “rich text editor” could be written as “RTE”. An abbreviation is a shortened form of a written word or phrase used in place of the whole word or phrase. “Amt” is an abbreviation for “amount”.

Our stance on acronyms:

- Avoid creating acronyms.
- Acronyms take longer to understand and might reduce adoption of a product, feature, or concept.
- Acronyms are like inside jokes—people who understand the acronym feel included in the meaning, but people who don’t feel left out and confused.
- If you have to use an acronym, spell it out the first time you use it and follow with the acronym in brackets.
- Internationally understood acronyms and abbreviations are acceptable, like the word “app” or “SEO”.

**Do**

- Rich text editor
- Multi label printing
- Merchant Success Manager
- Virtual reality
- Build a Bigger Business

**Don't**

- RTE
- MLP
- MSM
- VR
- BABB

Avoid using Internet slang acronyms in Shopify products and when creating new, branded names. These acronyms are exclusive to certain online communities and branded approachable for everyday merchants.

**Do**

- Shop Class

**Don't**

- Shopify IRL

Internationally understood acronyms and abbreviations are acceptable. Some of these include time zone, tax, barcode, weight, and size abbreviations.

**Do**

- SEO
- NZDT
- SMS
- QR codes
- HST
- CVV
- SKU
- ISBN
- UPC
- GTIN
- USD
- 1 kg
- 2 lbs
- App

**Don't**

- Search engine optimization
- New Zealand Daylight Time
- Short messaging service
- Quick response codes
- Harmonized sales tax
- Card verification value
- Stock keeping unit
- International standard book number
- Universal product code
- Global trade item number
- United States Dollar
- Kilogram
- 2 pounds
- Application

When using a country as an adjective (such as when referring to currency), you may use an abbreviated form without punctuation.

**Do**

- Pinterest requires your store to use US currency.

**Don't**

- Pinterest requires your store to use United States currency.

### **Similar names**

Being an ecommerce platform has its naming challenges. For example, a lot of feature names could include the word “shipping” or “pay”. Think merchant-first and be descriptive to differentiate the name. Imagine what it’s like to have conversations with merchants about similar names like Shopify Payments or around our pricing plans to identify names that might be confusing. Before naming a new product or feature:

- Conduct an audit of existing names to narrow down your naming choices
- Ask the support team to see if they think it’ll conflict with another name
- Draft a test conversation around similar sounding names

### **Localization and translation**

Names may not translate directly to other languages. Identify if you need to create a separate name, or if a direct translation will do.

Before confirming a name, check with people who work in translation and localization to find out if:

- There are cultural considerations
- A different name for a different location would have a positive impact for brand

Some already existing names are different depending where you’re from. For example, in North America, people say, “I’ll send you a text.” In India and Nordic countries, people say, “I’ll SMS you.” Do your research and find out what people call things in everyday conversations.

Use “text message” when writing for North American audiences.

**Do**

- text message

**Don't**

- SMS

Use SMS when writing for Indian and Nordic audiences.

**Do**

- SMS

**Don't**

- text message

### **Initials**

In languages that use logographic characters, like Japanese, name initials can have different meanings. For example, in Japanese a name like Chikako (周子) Ishikawa (石川) means “neighborhood stone” (周石) in initials. Check with the localization and translation team before writing something in short form in another language.

### **Avoiding negative connotations**

Some words or terms have unintended negative connotations for some audiences. Do some research to avoid associating offensive words or phrases with your product or feature name.

Start by:

- Getting people outside of your team to look at the name with a new perspective
- Doing a Google search to see if it surfaces with another meaning

## **Components**

Be strategic and consistent when naming [components](https://polaris-react.shopify.com/components). It makes it easier to create and build products and features for Shopify when people can switch between implementations and see the same names represented throughout. For example, we should use the same name across Rails, React, and Figma. It’s okay if each implementation has its own spelling convention. For example, “Account connection” in documentation and in Figma layer names, but “ui_account_connection” in Rails, and “AccountConnection” in React.

A good component name can:

- Increase adoption of a component
- Clarify where a component fits into our system
- Help establish a mental model for people using the components

Component names in documentation should:

- Describe the functionality they represent
- Avoid jargon so different disciplines understand its function
- Be written in singular, not plural, format

In documentation we write out the name without any punctuation and use sentence case, meaning, the first word is capitalized and the rest is lowercase.

**Do**

- Type scale
- Empty state

**Don't**

- TypeScale
- EmptyState

In code, we use the same name as the documentation, but can alter the spelling convention to suit the implementation.

**Do**

- TypeScale
- EmptyState

**Don't**

- Type scale
- Empty state

For subcomponents, the same rules apply. In documentation, write out the name with a space between words, and use sentence case. with

**Do**

- Layout section

**Don't**

- Layout.Section

For subcomponents in the code, use a period in place of the space.

**Do**

- Layout.Section

**Don't**

- Layout section

For all components, use American spelling:

**Do**

- Layout.Center
- Palette.Color

**Don't**

- Layout.Centre
- Palette.Colour

There is an exception: the Labelled component uses the British spelling, following the **aria-labelledby** attribute as per the [ARIA specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-labelledby) itself.

## **Icons**

Icons should be named consistently so they’re easy to find and implement across Shopify.

Overall, icon names should:

- Represent the intended function of the icon
- Avoid jargon so different disciplines understand its function

Product area icons should:

- Only be used to symbolize their specific product area or function

**Do**

- Home
- Orders
- Products

**Don't**

- House
- Invoice
- Price tag

Functional icons not tied to product areas should represent a clear action.

**Do**

- Add image

**Don't**

- Image

Icons with more than one function should be named to:

- Represent their purpose
- Describe how they look

**Do**

- Circle alert
- Camera
- Clock

**Don't**

- Alert
- Photography
- Time

# **Alternative text**

**Build inclusive experiences for merchants who use screen readers**

Alt text is a text replacement for an image. Generally, it is represented by the alt HTML element attribute **alt="alt text"**.

Often used by people who are blind or have low vision, screen readers announce alt text to explain images. Alt text will also display when images fail to download (for example, there’s an unstable or low-bandwidth network connection).

Alt text should:

- Help visitors navigate the site
- Provide an inclusive experience
- Be as short and specific as possible
- Be contextual to the intended message

## **Alt text for images**

Use alt text when the image conveys valuable information, such as the ability to play a demo video. Even if an image isn’t conveying meaningful information, don’t leave an **<img>** tag without an alt text element. The screen reader may try to read the filename and create a negative experience. Instead, let the screen reader know to ignore the image by setting the alt to an empty string.

All **<img>** tags need an alt text attribute, even if it’s empty. For example, set an empty alt text attribute using **<img alt="" />**.

**Do**

Example

```
<VideoThumbnail accessibilityLabel="Watch how-to video on Shopify reports." />

<Thumbnail alt="Black choker necklace" />

<Icon accessibilityLabel="" />
```

**Don't**

Example

```
<VideoThumbnail accessibilityLabel="Screenshot 2022-11-07 at 3.05.55 PM" />

<Thumbnail alt="Sneaker.png" />

<Icon accessibilityLabel="IMG_1206.heic" />
```

## **Writing alt text**

Always write alt text in plain text. The average rate of listening to a screen reader is 3x slower than that of an average visual reader. Many screen reader users listen at fast speeds to make up time. When writing alt text, be as brief as possible.

- Be concise. Think about how to write for a small amount of space or a character limit.
- Use simple words. If you’re stuck on how to replace a complicated word, check this [A-Z list of alternative words](https://www.plainenglish.co.uk/the-a-z-of-alternative-words.html) or these [plain language tips](https://polaris-react.shopify.com/content/product-content#write-for-a-7-grade-reading-level). Another good resource is the [Hemingway editor](https://hemingwayapp.com/).
- Avoid needless words. If a phrase is still understandable without a specific word, remove it.
- Remove articles like "a, an, one of," etc. whenever possible. Alt text has different grammatical rules. "Filler words" that assist understanding in speech can get in the way in alt text.
- Avoid using "image of" or "photograph" unless the type of image is relevant to the context. Screenreaders already announce images with use of the **<img>** attribute.
- Avoid punctuation like **!!** and emoji like 🥰. Screen readers will announce these as "exclamation point, exclamation point" and "smiling face with three hearts." Use other punctuation marks as you regularly would, such as commas, or periods at the ends of the sentences. The screen-reader will react with a brief pause.
- Only use acronyms you are confident your audience will understand. If using an acronym, write it with spaces in-between, like "Y M C A." Otherwise, most screen readers will try to read the acronym as a word.
- Write in the [active voice](https://polaris-react.shopify.com/content/grammar-and-mechanics#basics) when possible.

## **Alt text in context**

It can be tricky to decide whether an image needs alt text or should be ignored by screen readers. Ask yourself:

- Is it interactive?
- Does this image convey information that isn’t given elsewhere?
- Does the context of the image communicate anything?

The same image may have different alt text depending on what it conveys.

For example, if you’re using a photo of sneakers purely decoratively as the hero image for a blog, tell screen readers to skip it.

If you’re using the photo as an example of a certain type of sneaker mentioned in the blog, then convey relevant information about the image. For example, "High-top sneaker with gum soles."

But if you’re using this image in a product listing, ensure shoppers know the important details of what they are buying, such as "Converse Chuck Taylor All Star Classic Black."

### **Situations that need alt text**

### **Icons**

[Icons](https://polaris-react.shopify.com/components/images-and-icons/icon) that could be misinterpreted need an explanation, so use the Polaris **accessibilityLabel** prop or the **aria-label** HTML attribute. For interactive icons, don’t describe the image ("magnifying glass"). Instead, describe the action ("search").

Example

```
<Button accessibilityLabel="search" onClick={() => search()}>
  <Icon source={SearchIcon} accessibilityLabel="" />
</Button>
```

### **Actions**

Write [clear and predictable](https://polaris.shopify.com/content/actionable-language#links) link text. If space constraints require you to write calls to action that are unclear where they take you (like "Learn more" and "Apply now"), give further indication of where merchants will be sent after they select.

Example

```
<Link
  url="https://www.shopify.com/protect"
  accessibilityLabel="Learn more about Fraud Protect"
>
  Learn more
</Link>
```

### **Complex images**

Images with more complexity need some consideration. For example, groups of image elements can be described by a single text, rather than announcing each individual element.

Example

```
<div role="img" aria-labelledby="star_id">
  <LegacyStack>
    <Icon source={StarFilledIcon} alt="">
    <Icon source={StarFilledIcon} alt="">
    <Icon source={StarFilledIcon} alt="">
    <Icon source={StarIcon} alt="">
    <Icon source={StarIcon} alt="">
  </LegacyStack>
</div>
<div id="star_id">3 of 5 stars</div>
```

### **Situations that don’t need alt text**

Websites can sometimes be noisy for a screen reader user. While alt text is vital for an equal experience, the briefer you are, the happier your screen reader users will be. Avoid repetition and unnecessary announcements by setting **alt=""** in the scenarios that don’t need it.

### **Progress bars**

Progress bars often present visual information that can also be found in the text, such as "Loading 53%." Continuously announcing that change is generally considered annoying.

### **Decorative elements**

This is a broad category covering elements that are purely for aesthetic reasons, such as empty state illustrations, dividers, or hero images. If you’re unsure whether valuable information is lost, consider testing with people who regularly use a screen reader.

### **Images with adequate captions**

Avoid adding repetitive alt text if an image has a caption that accurately reflects the information in the image, for example a photo of George Washington that is captioned "George Washington." If the image is presenting information that isn’t in the caption, consider adding it to the caption text. Only if this isn’t possible or appropriate should you add that information as alt text.

If the image has a longer description in the caption or following paragraph text, you can associate this description with the **aria-describedby** attribute.

### **Tracking images**

Images that would not be visible to a sighted user should not be announced to screen-readers.

## **Pronunciation and translation**

Not only do we strive to make interactions with our products pleasant, but we want the listening experience for merchants to be positive, too. Always state the language of the page content with the HTML lang attribute. This will ensure pronunciation and translation tools will know what rules to use. If certain phrases are in a different language than the main content, you can also use the lang attribute in a **<p>** tag or similar.

Here’s a [standard list of language attributes](https://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry) that you can use in your document.

**Do**

Example

```
<html lang="en"></html>
<html lang="de"></html>
<html lang="pt-BR"></html>
```

**Don't**

Example

```
<html></html>
```

## **SEO**

Besides screen readers, search engines also read alt text. Alt text helps increase image ranking results and site searchability outside of Shopify’s admin.

When accounting for SEO in your alt text:

- Use logical keywords (the words that people search for).
- Include relevant listing details, like if it is a limited edition or unique colorway.
- Describe the image, not what you want your audience to think.
- Don’t repeat your site name or brand name. Search engines will already associate your site with your images.
- Avoid reducing the relevance or clarity of the alt text just to insert a keyword.
- Never include unassociated lists of key words in the alt text. Instead, place those in your [meta description](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/promoting-marketing/seo/adding-keywords#edit-the-title-and-meta-description-for-a-page).

**Do**

Example

```
<Thumbnail alt="1460 Boot Limited Edition Oxblood Women's" />
```

**Don't**

Example

```
<Thumbnail alt="shoes sneakers womens footwear girls sizes soles heels boots" />

<Thumbnail alt="Cool shoes for a night out or hot date" />
```

# **Inclusive language**

**Make commerce better for everyone by writing inclusively**

Clear and precise language creates a better experience for all users. Everyone interacting with Shopify should feel welcome and included.

Start by involving different perspectives in the planning process. Limit assumptions or biases by testing your content with a diverse audience. Recruit research participants from a variety of backgrounds, including historically excluded groups. Be aware of bias, and let those with lived experiences guide the way.

## **Writing principles**

Our language should reflect the diversity of Shopify merchants. Here are some principles for creating welcoming commerce experiences through writing.

- When talking **to people**, use language that considers others’ perspectives and lived experiences
- When talking **about people**, be descriptive only when necessary to the context, and use language preferred by the group being described
- When talking **about things**, be clear and accurate, avoiding metaphors and idioms

For more context on the etymology of terms mentioned in this guide, visit the EGAL [Inclusive Terms Glossary](https://www.egalresources.com/inclusive-terms-glossary).

## **Disability**

As technology advances, it’s important to remember that we continue to design for all levels of ability. Considering those with disabilities will make your content accessible and more inclusive.

To write accessible content:

- Center content around people, not their disabilities
- Be clear and avoid metaphors, euphemisms, and idioms
- Don’t imply that those with disabilities are abnormal, less than, or “suffering”
- Avoid words associated with disabilities to describe objects, features, or experiences

### **Recommended language**

### **Disable, disabled**

Don’t label actions or features using “disable” or “disabled.” This can imply that being disabled is a negative state. Alternatives include “turn off,” “inactive,” and “deactivated.”

Note: Because “disabled” is a valid state for HTML elements, it’s currently considered appropriate when talking about specific element states.

**Don't**

### **Deaf**

Only use this term to refer to actual deafness, not as a metaphor. Use lowercase, unless referring to the Deaf community.

### **Handicap, handicapped**

Don’t use this term to refer to someone’s disability. Be specific, such as:

- person who requires a keyboard accessible checkout
- person who uses an accessibility device

### **Blind**

Only use this term to reference actual blindness, not as a metaphor.

### **Insane, crazy**

Avoid using these words to describe something as extreme or unbelievable.

**Do**

- wild
- extreme
- unbelievable
- intense

**Don't**

- insane
- crazy
- nuts

### **Just, only, easy, etc.**

When writing instructional content, avoid saying the task itself is easy or quick. If you imply it’s easy for everyone, it can discourage those who might struggle.

While they are fine in the right context, watch out for these words:

- just
- only
- easy
- simple
- quick

Note: When marketing, it’s okay to use these words to communicate the value of a new product or feature.

## **Race**

We want all merchants to feel comfortable participating in commerce. Even if unintentional, language can exclude or harm people who have been historically marginalized due to their race, ethnicity, or culture. Consider the diversity of merchants’ lived experiences and be intentional about using language that is free of bias.

### **Tips**

- Don’t treat perspectives that are different from yours as exotic or strange
- Don’t use phrases or terms that denote “black” or “dark” as bad or negative, versus “white” or “light” as good or positive
- Avoid metaphors and idioms since they can have racist origins or interpretations

### **Recommended language**

### **Black hat, white hat (hacking)**

Avoid these terms since they imply that “white is good” and “black is bad.”

**Do**

- Unethical hacking
- Ethical hacking

**Don't**

- Black hat
- White hat

### **Blacklist, whitelist**

Avoid these terms since they imply that “white is good” and “black is bad.”

**Do**

- Denylist, blocklist
- Allowlist
- Permit, permitted

**Don't**

- Blacklist
- Whitelist
- Graylist

**Do**

### **Grandfather in, grandfather clause**

Avoid using these phrases, as they come from laws in the U.S. meant to circumvent or disenfranchise Black people’s rights.

**Do**

- Legacy, legacied
- Exempt

**Don't**

- Grandfather in, grandfathered in
- Grandfather clause

### **Master**

Avoid using this term, as many associate it with the institution of slavery.

**Do**

- main
- primary
- source
- expert

**Don't**

- master

## **Gender**

Gender is an important part of many people’s identity. Stereotypes and assumptions about gender can make their way into product experiences and leave people feeling excluded or misrepresented. When you do talk about gender, be intentional. Only use gendered language if it makes your content more inclusive and accurate.

### **Internationalization**

Many languages lack ungendered options, like the English “they.” When possible, write in a way that avoids gendered language. For example, write “you” instead of a third person pronoun. You may need to work with a translator to avoid unintentionally gendering concepts. Always choose the clearest option.

### **Recommended language**

Always use someone’s preferred gender and pronouns. If you’re not sure, use the pronouns “they/them.” This keeps the content inclusive, simple, and readable.

**Do**

Call the customer to confirm their address

**Don't**

Call the customer to confirm his or her address

If pronouns are necessary or useful to the experience, offer users an inclusive list of options that also allows them to opt out.

**Don't**

Don’t use language that associates roles, qualities, or objects with a specific gender.

**Do**

- synthetic
- workforce
- mail carrier

**Don't**

- man-made
- manpower
- mailman
